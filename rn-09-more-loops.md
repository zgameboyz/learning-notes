# Reading Notes Conditional Operators and Loops
## Operators
### Important assignment and conditional operators
```=``` assigns a value to a variable.  ``` ==``` Is a conditional operator that states two values are equivalent.  ```===``` Is a strick equivalent meaning it must be the same data type to be considered true. ```!=``` is a strict not equal to meaning if two values are of different data types or values it will return true.
```>``` Greater than
```<``` Less than
```>=``` Greater than or equal to
```<=``` Less than or equal to

### Logical Operators
```&&``` Logical and
```||``` Logical or
```!``` Logical Not

## Loops
### Loop counters

Initialization var i=0;                    
Condition i<10;                     
Update i++                  

## While loops
While loops allow a loop to run continuously as long as a condition remains true. It is accomplished using true statements until it is no longer true.
