# More Javascript Notes

## Scripts
Scripts are essentially a series of specific instructions in Javascript. Similar to an instruction manual for an Ikea chair or a cookbook.

Identify the steps needed first then proceed to code out the steps.

Flowcharts are a good way to design and identify the steps before coding.

## Expressions and Operators
**Expressions** are simply a small amount of code that assigns a value to a variable.
Ex. ```let color = 'yellow';```

**Operators** are used to assign the data such as the = opperator. There are others too like > which makes a comparason between two values to determine if one is bigger. You can even do multiplication with the * operator. 

## Functions
Functions are series of statements that when put together accomplish a task. To declare a function use the keyword function followed by parentheses. And for the code you want to follow should be in { } braces. 

Ex. ```function helloWorld(){document.write('hello');}```
