# I will take notes on my reading related to markdown.

There are a few key takeaways from the GitHub docs page. 

the "#" creates a size 1 header with multiple symbols creating subsequent sized headings.

To bold in markdown it is 2 pound symbols with **text**.

A singular pound creates *Italics*.

To create a strike through it is two tildes. ~~Strikeout~~

Words from Joel probably
>To quote a text use a greater than symbol.
