# Reading notes for github

Github is useful for version control. It allows you to make changes periodically while simultaneously backing up the past versions through the **commit** action. 
These *snapshots* are instances of your file that you can go back and use if you encounter a problem in the future. This is extrememely useful in the event of a big accident or if the code breaks.
