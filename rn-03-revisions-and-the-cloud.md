# Reading notes for github

Github is useful for version control. It allows you to make changes periodically while simultaneously backing up the past versions through the **commit** action. 
These *snapshots* are instances of your file that you can go back and use if you encounter a problem in the future. This is extrememely useful in the event of a big accident or if the code breaks.

### Some useful commands

The ```git status command``` allows you to see the current status of the file. 
The life cycle of a file changes from Untracked ---> Unmodified ---> Modified ---> Staged

The cycles change by add, remove, edit, commmit, and stage file.

The fartherst cycle is called HEAD or the most current version that has been pushed.

>```git commit -m "message to commit"```

### git remote Command
The ```git remote command``` allows you to view short names of all specified remote handles.
