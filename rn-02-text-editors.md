# My notes on Text editors, The command Line, Basic Navigation, and Files

## Text Editors

Text editors are plentiful all with their own bells and whistles. Some of them have auto complete text to help code faster. Others will colorize different types of words. There seems to be no *best* text editor as it is mostly a preference of the developer. There seems to be an extension called Emmet that makes your coding much faster by short handing the code. Microsoft Visual Code.
    
### Command Line

One of the benefits of the command line is that you can run multiple commands simultaneously. This is beneficial for saving time. 
    
### Basic Navigation
    
pwd stands for Print Working Directory it tells the user's current location in the Directory. 
    
ls stands for list and it can be passed arguments to find more specific actions. some sample arguements are -l or /etc.
    
### Files 

In linux everything is a file. The type of file is normally denoted by its extension such as .jpg for a picture. In Linux you do not need to have an extension as it looks directly at the file to determine what type it is. Linux files are Case-Sensitive meaning different files can have the same name as long as the case is different. If you want to name something with a space between it you should put it in quotations. ls -a allows the user to see all files including hidden files.
