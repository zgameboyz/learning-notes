### Formatting

A website should know its audience and format the way it looks with that in mind. Before worrying about creating a website we must create a shell of what it might look like called the wireframe. 
It is important to create the frame of the website so the creator can make sure it is structured and fits your end goal. 
If a website is for kids you might want big buttons that are colorful and is very simple to navigate. Perhaps for adults you might want to make a professional looking website that is very clean and easy to navigate. 

### Coding

There are a number of important tags to take into consideration when creating a webpage with html. You must start the text file with a doctype declaration to tell it is an html file. It is important for your website to have a header, body, and many other tags like footer.

Some of the tags for html5 are

```
<header>
<footer>
<nav>
<article>
<aside>
<section>
<hgroup>
<figure>
<figcaption>
<div>
```
Be warned some tags are not recognized by older browsers.
