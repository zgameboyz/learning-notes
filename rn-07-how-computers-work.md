# How compueters work

Computers are basically very complicated calculators. They are extremely fast at making small binary calculations oftens thousands and thousands at a time if not more. A computer takes an input through a variety of means from the user and converts that into binary which it uses to run programs. Those programs will have algorithms to create an output. 

There are many components to a computer. The CPU, The GPU, The Power Supply, Cooling systems, and the motherboard which houses the cpu. When a computer takes in information the CPU processess all that information and sends it out. The operating system will run programs and determine which programs are able to be run at the time and will allocate resources to ensure they run.

Modern coding is not in binary but in a variety of programming languages that are easy for humans to understand instead of just 1's and 0's.
